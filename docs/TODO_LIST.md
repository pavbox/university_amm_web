## Simple task list

- [ ] setup mainpage basic design by react
- [x] moves to stylus or postcss
- [x] make a plan in the notebook
- [ ] setup webpack production/dev mode

### MAYBE MOVE TO NODEJS INSTEAD OF PYTHON?

`for nodejs`

- faster development
- very good integrations
- modern software stack
- easy, clean code
- API's guidelines/frameworks

`for python`

- python backend experience
- more relevant for docker, k8s, etc.
- ML integrations (don't needs?)
- newest experience/script language (maybe will be helpful)
