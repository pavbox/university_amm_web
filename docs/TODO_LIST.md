### MAYBE MOVE TO NODEJS INSTEAD OF PYTHON?

`for nodejs`

- faster development
- very good integrations
- modern software stack
- easy, clean code
- API's guidelines/frameworks
- needs to pay for one instance (only nodejs, not python server)

`for python`

- python backend experience
- more relevant for docker, k8s, etc.
- ML integrations (don't needs?)
- newest experience/script language (maybe will be helpful)
